Web development takes a lot of software and servers just to get started. In this blog I will describe the stack that I am using on my daily work and also on my hobby projects.

Here is my full stack:

* Ubuntu linux
* Aegir
* Barracuda
* Sublime
* NVM
* RVM
* Inkscape
* The Gimp
* Firefox (and all the other browsers)

### [Ubuntu linux](http://ubuntu.com)

I started using linux when I was 14 years old. I started with Fedora Core 3. I liked depth of control that Linux gives. I used to customize xorg.conf and things like that. Nowadays I am more of a user than a tweaker.

I have encrypted my hard disk, and most of the time I am using a stable version. Sometimes I install a development version. I am looking forward to the convergence of Ubuntu. I think it would be awesome when I can switch to a super mobile and some docking stations instead of a laptop.

### [Aegir](http://aegirproject.org)

On my local stack I am using Aegir. It is a Drupal hosting panel. It is build on Drupal and it manages Drupal sites. It creates all the vhost files and the databases. It is very simple to install a new Drupal site. It is even possible to only use a link, paste that into aegir and it builds the whole site.

### [Barracuda](https://github.com/omega8cc/boa)

Barracuda is a shielded version of aegir. You can install it on top of Debian or Ubuntu. I use Debian because that is the system it get's tested on. At the company I work, we use barracuda for all the production servers for over two years and personaly I use it too. It is very simple to configure, and very difficult and complex to modify. It is also very safe, and protection configured.

### [Sublime text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)

I use sublime as my text editor. I am planning on switching to an IDE because of Drupal 8 development, but for the time being I am using sublime text 3. I think it is a simple to use editor with right amount of plugins. Code checking with automated scripts work fine and the snipplets are nice too.

### [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

I use nvm (node version manager), it is very simple to install and it saves a lot of problems with node versions.

### [RVM](https://rvm.io/)

Same as NVM but than for Ruby. It saves a lot of dependency problems. Especially in combination of bundler.

### [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org)

My background is more from a designer perspective than from a programmer. I program since 7 years and designing is something I did since I was young. I started with CorelDRAW and Illustrator and switched to Inkscape when using linux. I think Inkscape is almost as powerful as Illustrator. For the web, I think it is good enough, for press it doesn't have cymk support so would be a big trouble.

I use it for creating logos, websites and print stuff.

### [The GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)

I use the Gimp daily for opening psd files, sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. Some of the guys at the office have photoshop and some designers post screenshot in the client folder. For hobby things I used the Gimp for editing photo's.

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Personally I use firefox most of the time, I like the built in debugging tools and firebug. I simply started with it and kept using it. It is practically at the office, because some use safari, others chrome so we use most of the widely spread browsers.

This is just a place to put down all the things that I use, so I hope over time this will be changed and expanded.
