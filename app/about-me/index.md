I am Daniel. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

Late nights, with a bit of a fever like spirit, a glass of whiskey, and a lot of lines of code. That are evenings that I enjoy. I have created a lot of failed projects, two failed companies, and many more experiments. I have learned that programming is learning and failing and once in a while suceeding.

My interests are broad, I like music, I like programming, most of all I like to create things. Be it music, visuals or programs, it gives me a sense of joy when somethings is finaly finnished.

Another interest of me is explaining things, seeing how one can learn and improve if having the right interests and mindset. I like to give technical talks, explaining a thing that I have learned, so that an other maybe have a shorter time of learning for that thing.

That is why I have created this blog.

Kind regards, Daniel
